# jens_site
Web site for a high school English teacher.  The site will be the jumping off point for students to access various Google apps such as Google docs, Google drive, and Google classroom. There will also be a calendar page which shows assignments and due dates. The calendar will be accessible to students but they will not be able to edit it.
